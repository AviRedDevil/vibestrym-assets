This repository contains free assets used by the Vibestrym course — a Real Full-stack Twitch clone built with a NestJS backend, a Next.js frontend, and many more industry standard technologies. The assets here are provided so you can complete the course locally.

## Contents

- Backend: example NestJS server (see `backend/`)
- Frontend: Next.js app (see `frontend/`)
- Assets: images, categories, channels, and streams data (see `assets/`)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ (recommended) — https://nodejs.org/
- Yarn or npm
- Docker & Docker Compose (for local Postgres + Redis)
- On macOS with Apple Silicon, ensure Docker supports arm64 images

If you're a beginner: install Node.js first, then run `node -v` and `npm -v` to confirm.
